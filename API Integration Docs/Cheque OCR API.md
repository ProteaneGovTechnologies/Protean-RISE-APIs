# Cheque OCR API

## 📘 What is Cheque OCR?

The **Cheque OCR (Optical Character Recognition) API** converts scanned or uploaded cheque images into structured, machine-readable data. It automates the extraction of key details like **account number**, **IFSC code**, **account holder name**, and **bank name**—removing the need for manual entry and reducing operational delays.

This API is ideal for onboarding journeys, document verification flows, and back-office automation where cheques are still a part of the process.
