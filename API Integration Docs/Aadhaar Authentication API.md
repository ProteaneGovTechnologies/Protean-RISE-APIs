# Aadhaar Authentication API

## 📘 Introduction to Aadhaar Authentication

**Aadhaar Authentication** enables real-time identity verification by validating an individual’s Aadhaar number and associated demographic or biometric data against the **Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR)** maintained by **UIDAI**.

It is widely used to ensure **secure access** to services, benefits, and subsidies by public and private service providers. While Aadhaar Auth is a powerful method of validation, it does not grant citizenship or domicile rights.

  Instantly verify individuals before disbursing welfare benefits, subsidies, or entitlements.

## 🔐 Modes of Authentication

1. **Demographic Authentication (Demo Auth)**  
   Matches Aadhaar number with demographic data like name, DOB, gender, etc.

2. **OTP-Based Authentication**  
   Sends a time-bound OTP to the Aadhaar-linked mobile/email. Used for secure one-step validation.

3. **Biometric Authentication**  
   Matches fingerprint, iris, or facial data with records in the CIDR.

4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**  
   Combines OTP + biometric/demographic checks for added security.

> Note: **e-KYC authentication** is allowed only via **OTP or biometric**.

## 📜 Customer Consent & Legal Compliance

- 💬 **Consent is Mandatory**: Aadhaar authentication requires **explicit consent** from the individual, as mandated by UIDAI.

- 🏛️ **Usage by Government Entities**:  
  Central or State Governments can mandate Aadhaar authentication for welfare delivery under Sections 8 & Chapter VI of the Aadhaar Act.

- 🛡️ **Alternative Options**:  
  If an individual does not yet have an Aadhaar, the service provider must offer alternative means of identity verification.

- 🔐 **Limited Data Usage**:  
  Identity data collected must only be used for CIDR submission and cannot be stored or reused beyond what’s permitted.
