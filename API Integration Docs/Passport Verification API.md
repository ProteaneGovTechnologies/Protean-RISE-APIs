# Passport Verification API

## 📘 What is Passport Verification?

The **Passport Verification API** allows organizations to authenticate an individual’s identity by cross-referencing the information on their Indian passport with authoritative government records.

It validates the **Passport File Number** and **Date of Birth** to confirm authenticity, detect inconsistencies, and flag any potential tampering of personal information. This API is particularly useful for companies with international engagements or cross-border workforce requirements.
