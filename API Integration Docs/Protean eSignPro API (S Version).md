## 🚫 The Problem with Traditional Paperwork

- **Security Risks:** Physical docs are prone to breaches and unauthorized access.  
- **Geographical Delays:** Remote signatories slow down critical approvals.  
- **Poor Visibility:** No real-time tracking or workflow auditability.  
- **Manual Inefficiencies:** Print-sign-scan-store cycles are slow and error-prone.
