# Mobile Verification with OTP API

## 📘 What is Mobile Verification with OTP?

The **Mobile Number Verification API** validates the authenticity of a user’s mobile number by sending a one-time password (OTP) for verification. It ensures that the number belongs to the user attempting to authenticate, and helps businesses build trusted communication channels with their customers.

This process is widely used in onboarding flows, login authorizations, eKYC, and fraud prevention systems—especially in BFSI, eCommerce, and telecom.
