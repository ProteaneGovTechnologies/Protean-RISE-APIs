# Face Liveness (Passive) API

## 📘 What is Face Liveness (Passive)?

The **Face Liveness (Passive) API** uses advanced AI models to assess the **liveness of a face** from a static image—without requiring any user movement or interaction.

By analyzing facial textures, lighting inconsistencies, and micro-expressions, the API returns a **liveness score** that helps determine if the face is real or spoofed (e.g., printed photo, screen replay, or synthetic face). It's ideal for **frictionless KYC**, **biometric authentication**, and **anti-deepfake verification**.
