# IFSC Verification API

## ðŸ“˜ What is IFSC?

IFSC stands for **Indian Financial System Code**â€”an 11-character alphanumeric code assigned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to uniquely identify bank branches across India.

This code is essential for facilitating secure and accurate electronic fund transfers through various modes including:

- NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer)  
- RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement)  
- IMPS (Immediate Payment Service)  
- ECS (Electronic Clearing System)

Each IFSC code helps route payments to the correct branch, reducing transaction errors and delays.
