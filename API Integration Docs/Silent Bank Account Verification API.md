# Silent Bank Account Verification API

## 📘 What is Silent Bank Account Verification?

The **Silent Bank Account Verification API** enables secure and real-time validation of a bank account holder’s name based on their **account number** and **IFSC code**—without initiating any fund transfer (also known as "non-penny drop" verification).

This API makes a verification call through NPCI rails to retrieve the name linked to the bank account, making it ideal for frictionless onboarding, payouts, or vendor verification—especially in regulated or high-speed environments.
