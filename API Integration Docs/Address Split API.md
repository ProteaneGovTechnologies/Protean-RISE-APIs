# Address Split API

## 📘 What is Address Split?

The **Address Split API** takes raw or unstructured address input and intelligently splits it into structured components—like **house number**, **street**, **city**, **state**, **postal code**, and **country**.

Built for systems that handle user-submitted or bulk-uploaded address data, this API improves **data quality**, supports **geo-based analytics**, and reduces **manual cleaning effort**—all while boosting operational accuracy.
