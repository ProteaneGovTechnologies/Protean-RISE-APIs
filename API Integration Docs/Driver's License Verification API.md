# Driver's License Verification API

## 📘 What is Driver's License Verification?

The **Driver's License Verification API** by Protean allows real-time validation of driving license details issued by Road Transport Offices (RTOs) across India. It cross-verifies submitted license numbers with government databases to confirm the authenticity and validity of the identity document.

This enhances onboarding workflows by reducing fraud risk, accelerating KYC checks, and ensuring regulatory compliance—especially in sectors like fintech, logistics, mobility, and insurance.
