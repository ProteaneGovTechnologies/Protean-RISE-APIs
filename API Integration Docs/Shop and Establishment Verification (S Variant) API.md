# Shop & Establishment Verification (S Variant) API

## 📘 What is Shop and Establishment Verification (S Variant)?

To operate any commercial entity—shops, hotels, restaurants, retail outlets, etc.—individuals and organizations must register under the **Shop and Establishment Act**, verified by their state’s labor department. This license ensures legal compliance and protection of worker rights.

This **“S Variant”** of the API provides secure validation of certificates issued by municipal and local authorities across a defined set of regions in India. It helps prevent fraud and supports regulatory compliance by verifying establishment legitimacy.
