# Face Match API

## 📘 What is Face Match?

The **Face Match API** uses **advanced facial recognition technology** to compare faces across KYC documents and user-provided photographs. It enables organizations to verify whether two face images belong to the same person—boosting identity assurance in onboarding, re-authentication, and fraud prevention workflows.

This API is especially critical for digital journeys involving **video KYC**, **remote onboarding**, or **multi-document verification**—where visual consistency is key to trust.
